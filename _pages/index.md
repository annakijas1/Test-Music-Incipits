# Rebalancing the Music Canon

This open-access music data project aims to make works by un(der)-represented people more discoverable, decenter the musical canon, and make data-driven music scholarship more diverse and inclusive. The nature of this project is iterative, because it is being used as a way to teach students about transcription and encoding. Background about the current and past iterations of this project can be found on this [page](https://annakijas1.github.io/Test-Music-Incipits/about/).

The project repository will contain a dataset of music incipits and excerpts from a large historical period by an un(der)-represented group (primarily women and people of color) that has generally been left out of (big) data driven scholarship work. And, we envision this repository serving as a companion to other projects that bring visibility to un(der)-represented people, in particular:
