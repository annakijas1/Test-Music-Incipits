## 2020
The current project is focused on encoding musical incipits (initial melodic line of a composition or each movement) that can be used as a thematic index for locating compositions in the Lilly Music Library and will focus on works by women, people of color, and underrepresented composers.

## 2017-2019
The initial project goal was to work with musical works from the [Music Theory Examples by Women (MTEW) project](https://musictheoryexamplesbywomen.com/), which features excerpts and complete musical compositions by women composers, including women of color. It is used by music theory, history, and performance faculty, and students, as well as secondary music teachers. MTEW has a diverse corpus of music by women from which we can draw, and the data we extract and encode will be made available via their project for greater visibility and reuse.

The list of compositions and composers that we worked with is drawn from the MTEW project and can be viewed in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10BWNZQ0e5EduUB_UBJpDdROjY3VetWvAucYGhnGXaGo/edit#gid=970050992). The extracted data was checked against the score listed in the spreadsheet and can be found as a PDF on the MTEW site. We do not store the score PDFs in this repository.

#### Process
Data was extracted from music scores (PDF) using optical music recognition (OMR) tools, was edited with notation software, and transformed into symbolic music notation (encoded data) in MusicXML and MEI XML formats. An MEI template and files were created according to the MEI guidelines. [Music data](https://github.com/annakijas1/Test-Music-Incipits/tree/main/assets/corpus1) was organized into three buckets: Extracted Data, Corrected Data, Encoded Data.

- Extracted Data: contains Music XML files extracted directly from music notation software (SmartScore X2 Pro). These files are not corrected

- Corrected Data: contains corrected and reviewed Music XML files

- Encoded Data: contains MEI XML files based on the corrected Music XML files
