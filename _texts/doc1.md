We are beginning with a small corpus (about 178 pieces) shared by the [Music Theory Examples by Women (MTEW) project](https://musictheoryexamplesbywomen.com/). Their work includes the compilation of excerpts and complete musical compositions by women composers, including women of color. It is used by music theory, history, and performance faculty, and students, as well as secondary music teachers. MTEW has a diverse corpus of music by women from which we can draw, and the data we extract and encode will be made available via their project for greater visibility and reuse.

The list of compositions and composers that will be encoded is drawn from the MTEW project and can be viewed in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10BWNZQ0e5EduUB_UBJpDdROjY3VetWvAucYGhnGXaGo/edit#gid=970050992). Extracted data will be checked against the score listed in the spreadsheet and can be found as a PDF on the MTEW site. The music documents (PDF files) can also be shared with interested contributors. We will not store the score PDFs in this repository.

## Process
Data will be extracted from music scores (PDF) using optical music recognition (OMR) tools, it will be edited with notation software, and transformed into symbolic music notation (encoded data) in MusicXML and MEI XML formats. An MEI template and files will be created according to the MEI guidelines. Within each corpus, our data will be organized into three buckets: Extracted Data, Corrected Data, Encoded Data. Documentation about the process will be added to the repository.

### [Corpus 1](https://github.com/annakijas1/Test-Music-Incipits/tree/main/assets/corpus1)
- Extracted Data: contains Music XML files extracted directly from music notation software (SmartScore X2 Pro). These files are not corrected

- Corrected Data: contains corrected and reviewed Music XML files

Encoded Data: contains MEI XML files based on the corrected Music XML files

Ben Parsell and Molly Murdock of the Music Theory Examples by Women project were kind enough to share the music score PDFs that make up this initial corpus.
